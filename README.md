# weather-Dashboard

## Description 

I used weather API to create this website

It is working by the search if its an invalid link or wrong search it alarts the error

They also store the information into the local storage and generates the click bar on the left when you reload the page

With the icon link I also generated the icon to the weather list for the cuurent weather such as sunny cloudy 

In this icon I put the alt elements which is main on the weater API data which is describing the weather status
